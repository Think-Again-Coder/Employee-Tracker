# Employee Tracker 

## Week 12 Challenge

---
## *Description:* 

This application was created to give the user(manager) a way to track employee information stored in a Database. Finding an employee via department, role, or name are all features of the database created for the user. This was the first attempt at using Express.js for the backend while also learning to join to two tables together.

## *Process:*

This application was built to work on the backend only, user information is accessed via mySQL in databases.

A notable feature is the ability to scroll through menus for search via an employee's title, salary, or department id. 

The images here represents an example of the tables used to display information for the user.

### Summary: 

Althought this is currently incomplete you can see that the structure in the SQL Database is complete with schema and seeds.This is a great tool for anybody who may need access employee information.
